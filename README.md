# PWM-Drawer-Oscilloscope-
Developed an embedded project using ATmega32 and a graphical LCD. Analyzes PWM waves generated internally  via Timer 0 or 2, or external waves, using Timer 1's input capture unit. Displays the frequency, time, and duty cycle  on the LCD, along with a graphical representation of the PWM wave.
